Lab 5 by Zachary Schroeder and Gerard Puhalla 

The scene uses randomly generated points that the object moves through. 
The object moves according to a path defined by a Catmull-Rom spline, and loops back to the first point after reaching the last point.
The object moves with a constant speed along curves given by arc length reparameterization.
The speed of the object increases during the start of the animation and decreases towards the end.
The object faces the direction it is moving.

Lab 4 by Gerard Puhalla and Zack Schroeder

NOTE: This project was set nup using tags to label things
Since tags are not included in the unitypackage export, I have submitted the TagManager.asset file along with the unity project
The TagManager.asset file must be placed in the ProjectSettings Folder for the project or the game will crash when a prey dies

Predators, represented by the red spheres, chase Prey, represented by the blue spheres, who will try to run away when spotted
Both predators and prey use Field of vision to test if they see anything
Both change colors when entering Chase mode for predators or RunAway mode for Prey
Both avoid the fixed obstacles and walls in the arena they start in
Both can not see through the fixed obstacle
Both have their field of vision represented by colored rays coming out of the sphere while in Game mode

In this scene, a capsule is the source point for the spawning of spheres, called balls in the code, which act as particles.
The particles update their color based on their lifespan, and the scene can spawn particles infinitely. The particles collide with angled planes on 3 sides.
The scene can be controlled by using the arrow keys to move the capsule that spawns the particles, using W/S to increase and decrease the starting speed of the particles respectively, and using A/D to decrease and increase the rate of particle spawning respectively.

Lab 6 by Zachary Schroeder and Gerard Puhalla 

Our Lab focuses on inverse kinematics. In the unity scene, there is a gold crane arm at the center, a red boxed area to the side of the crane, and red spheres that generate around the crane.
The basic function of the scene is the crane arm moving to one of the red spheres, picking it up, and then depositing it in the red box.
The crane arm does this by using inverse kinematics multiple times to calculate the correct angle for each arm of the crane to be at to pick up the sphere.
The crane has 2 different methods of sphere collection, an automatic method, and a user input method.
The crane defaults to the automatic method, where the crane moves and puts all the spheres in the box by itself.
However, should a user click on a specific sphere, the crane will move that sphere to the box. This serves as the user input method.

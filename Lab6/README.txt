Lab 6 by Zachary Schroeder and Gerard Puhalla 

Our Lab focuses on inverse kinematics. In the unity scene, there is a gold crane arm at the center, a red boxed area to the side of the crane, and red spheres that generate around the crane.
The basic function of the scene is the crane arm moving to one of the red spheres, picking it up, and then depositing it in the red box.
The crane arm does this by using inverse kinematics multiple times to calculate the correct angle for each arm of the crane to be at to pick up the sphere.
The scene has 2 different modes, an automatic mode, and a user input mode, which can be switched by pressing Q.
In automatic mode, the crane moves and puts all the spheres in the box by itself. In user input mode, the user clicks on the sphere they want the crane to move to the box.
